            <P class="com2">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking
                to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing 
               experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly 
               fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best- and 
               most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've Successfully 
               switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</P>

                <P class="text">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.Ineeded some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step I was encouraged to enroll by a fomer student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
                    was outstaning. It took my learning to thr next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
                fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my devlopent experience
            it certainly helped me land a jobas a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% rocommend! "  </P>
